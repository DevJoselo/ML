<h2 class="c0"><span class="c2">Machine Learning Interview Questions: Categories</span></h2>
<p class="c0">We’ve traditionally seen machine learning interview questions pop up in several categories. The first really has to do with the algorithms and theory behind machine learning. You’ll have to show an understanding of how algorithms compare with one another and how to measure their efficacy and accuracy in the right way. The second category has to do with your programming skills and your ability to execute on top of those algorithms and the theory. The third has to do with your general interest in machine learning: you’ll be asked about what’s going on in the industry and how you keep up with the latest machine learning trends. Finally, there are company or industry-specific questions that test your ability to take your general machine learning knowledge and turn it into actionable points to drive the bottom line forward.</p>
<p class="c0">We’ve divided this guide to machine learning interview questions into the categories we mentioned above so that you can more easily get to the information you need when it comes to machine learning interview questions.</p>
<h3 id="h.e6coi6786274" class="c0 c3">Machine Learning Interview Questions: Algorithms/Theory</h3>
<p class="c0">These algorithms questions will test your grasp of the theory behind machine learning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="c2">Q1- What’s the trade-off between bias and variance?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias-variance_tradeoff" target="_blank">Bias-Variance Tradeoff (Wikipedia)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">Bias is error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm you’re using. This can lead to the model <span class="c7">underfitting</span>&nbsp;your data, making it hard for it to have high predictive accuracy and for you to generalize your knowledge from the training set to the test set.</p>
<p class="c0">Variance is error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm you’re using. This leads to the algorithm being highly sensitive to high degrees of variation in your training data, which can lead your model to <span class="c7">overfit</span>&nbsp;the data. You’ll be carrying too much noise from your training data for your model to be very useful for your test data.</p>
<p class="c0">The <span class="c2">bias-variance decomposition </span>essentially decomposes the learning error from any algorithm by adding the bias, the variance and a bit of irreducible error due to noise in the underlying dataset. Essentially, if you make the model more complex and add more variables, you’ll lose bias but gain some variance — in order to get the optimally reduced amount of error, you’ll have to <span class="c2">tradeoff</span>&nbsp;bias and variance. You don’t want either high bias or high variance in your model.</p>
<p><strong><span class="c2">Q2- What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading: <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-algorithms">What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning? (Quora)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">Supervised learning requires training labeled data. For example, in order to do classification (a supervised learning task), you’ll need to first label the data you’ll use to train the model to classify data into your labeled groups. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, does not require labeling data explicitly.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q3- How is KNN different from k-means clustering?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em>More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-k-nearest-neighbor-algorithm-different-from-k-means-clustering" target="_blank">How is the k-nearest neighbor algorithm different from k-means clustering? (Quora)</a></em></p>
<p class="c0">K-Nearest Neighbors is a <span class="c2">supervised classification algorithm</span>, while <span class="c2">k-means clustering</span>&nbsp;is an <span class="c2">unsupervised clustering algorithm</span>. While the mechanisms may seem similar at first, what this really means is that in order for K-Nearest Neighbors to work, you need labeled data you want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor part). K-means clustering requires only a set of unlabeled points and a threshold: the algorithm will take unlabeled points and gradually learn how to cluster them into groups by computing the mean of the distance between different points.</p>
<p class="c0">The critical difference here is that KNN needs labeled points and is thus supervised learning, while k-means doesn’t — and is thus unsupervised learning.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q4- Explain how a ROC curve works.</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic" target="_blank">Receiver operating characteristic (Wikipedia)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between true positive rates and the false positive rate at various thresholds. It’s often used as a proxy for the trade-off between the sensitivity of the model (true positives) vs the fall-out or the probability it will trigger a false alarm (false positives).</p>

<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q5- Define precision and recall.</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall" target="_blank">Precision and recall (Wikipedia)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">Recall is also known as the true positive rate: the amount of positives your model claims compared to the actual number of positives there are throughout the data. Precision is also known as the positive predictive value, and it is a measure of the amount of accurate positives your model claims compared to the number of positives it actually claims. It can be easier to think of recall and precision in the context of a case where you’ve predicted&nbsp;that there were 10 apples and 5 oranges in a case of 10 apples. You’d have perfect recall (there are actually 10 apples, and you predicted there would be 10) but 66.7% precision because out of the 15 events you predicted, only 10 (the apples) are correct.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q6-</span>&nbsp;<span class="c2">What is Bayes’ Theorem? How is it useful in a machine learning context?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em>More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/" target="_blank">An Intuitive (and Short) Explanation of Bayes’ Theorem (BetterExplained)</a></em></p>
<p class="c0">Bayes’ Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given what is known as prior knowledge.</p>
<p class="c0">Mathematically, it’s expressed as the true positive rate of a condition sample divided by the sum&nbsp;of the false positive rate of the population and the true positive rate of a condition. Say you had a 60% chance of actually having the flu after a flu test, but out of people who had the flu, the test will be false 50% of the time, and the overall population only has a 5% chance of having the flu. Would you actually have a 60% chance of having the flu after having a positive test?</p>
<p class="c0">Bayes’ Theorem says no. It says that you have a (.6 * 0.05) (True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) / (.6*0.05)(True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) + (.5*0.95) (False Positive Rate of a Population) &nbsp;= 0.0594 or <span class="c2">5.94% chance of getting a flu</span>.</p>
<p class="c0"><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Rh_wFkT2To6Fnl2fpIiU_irKK58Sfy_-cb-wprx1l28bSUQ3ZhkA0iN7sMkUBbv3TIJ2QKnrcCjy6p1auJtKjlNvQ4AKBqFAZ70J5085YIVgQkB9MTlr_FfRwWxVrC8HA0nIPGml" alt="machine learning interview questions" width="641" height="411"></p>
<p class="c0">Bayes’ Theorem is the basis behind a branch of machine learning that most notably includes the <span class="c2">Naive Bayes classifier</span>. That’s something important to consider when you’re faced with machine learning interview questions.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q7- Why is “Naive” Bayes naive?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-naive-Bayes-naive?share=1" target="_blank">Why is “naive Bayes” naive? (Quora)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">Despite its practical applications, especially in text mining, Naive Bayes is considered “Naive” because it makes an assumption that is virtually impossible to see in real-life data: the conditional probability is calculated as the pure product&nbsp;of the individual probabilities of components. This implies the absolute independence of features — a condition probably never met in real life.</p>
<p class="c0">As a Quora commenter put it whimsically, a Naive Bayes classifier that figured out that you liked pickles and ice cream would probably naively recommend you a pickle ice cream.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q8- Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-L1-and-L2-regularization" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-L1-and-L2-regularization', 'What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization? (Quora)');" class="c1">What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization? (Quora)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 is more binary/sparse, with many variables either being assigned a 1 or 0 in weighting. L1 corresponds to setting a Laplacean prior on the terms, while L2 corresponds to a Gaussian prior.</p>
<p class="c0"><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vXUSHKE11Qpolek11IPPP6Fs-iU1-LeWtf5EXVdrfOl97ytug_cME-vLF1t4BNvoAppxfRhx4dNzHoKkdl8dfGVix4jc2hhvrtDG_wyuByxpVfeFZQdMH-INzG6RSi_9jkJLERto" alt="machine learning interview questions" width="480" height="480"></p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q9- What’s your favorite algorithm, and can you explain it to me in less than a minute?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0">This type of question tests your understanding of how to communicate complex and technical nuances with poise and the ability to summarize quickly and efficiently. Make sure you have a choice and make sure you can explain different algorithms so simply and effectively that a five-year-old could grasp the basics!</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"><strong>Q10- What’s the difference between Type I and Type II error?</strong></span></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors', 'Type I and type II errors (Wikipedia)');" class="c1" target="_blank">Type I and type II errors (Wikipedia)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">Don’t think that this is a trick question! Many machine learning interview questions will be an attempt to&nbsp;lob basic questions at you just to make sure you’re on top of your game and you’ve prepared all of your bases.</p>
<p class="c0">Type I error is a false positive, while Type II error is a false negative. Briefly stated, Type I error means claiming something has happened when it hasn’t, while Type II error means that you claim nothing is happening when in fact something is.</p>
<p class="c0">A clever way to think about this is to think of Type I error as telling a man he is pregnant, while Type II error means you tell a pregnant woman she isn’t carrying a baby.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q11- What’s a Fourier transform?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em>More reading: <span class="c5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform', 'Fourier transform (Wikipedia)');" class="c1" target="_blank">Fourier transform (Wikipedia)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">A Fourier transform is a generic method to decompose generic functions into a superposition of symmetric functions. Or as this <span class="c5"><a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/', 'more intuitive tutorial');" class="c1" target="_blank">more intuitive tutorial</a></span>&nbsp;puts it, given a smoothie, it’s how we find the recipe. The Fourier transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes and phases to match any time signal. A Fourier transform converts a signal from time to frequency domain — it’s a very common way to extract features from audio signals or other time series such as sensor data.</p>

<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q13-</span>&nbsp;<span class="c2">What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with other machine learning algorithms?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning', 'Deep learning (Wikipedia)');" class="c1" target="_blank">Deep learning (Wikipedia)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with neural networks: how to use backpropagation and certain principles from neuroscience to more accurately model large sets of unlabelled or semi-structured data. In that sense, deep learning represents an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns representations of data through the use of neural nets.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q14- What’s the difference between a generative and discriminative model?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/879432/what-is-the-difference-between-a-generative-and-discriminative-algorithm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/879432/what-is-the-difference-between-a-generative-and-discriminative-algorithm', 'What is the difference between a Generative and Discriminative Algorithm? (Stack Overflow)');" class="c1" target="_blank">What is the difference between a Generative and Discriminative Algorithm? (Stack Overflow)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">A generative model will learn categories of data while a discriminative model will simply learn the distinction between different categories of data. Discriminative models will generally outperform generative models on classification tasks.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q15- What cross-validation technique would you use on a time series dataset?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/14099/using-k-fold-cross-validation-for-time-series-model-selection" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/14099/using-k-fold-cross-validation-for-time-series-model-selection', 'Using k-fold cross-validation for time-series model selection (CrossValidated)');" class="c1" target="_blank">Using k-fold cross-validation for time-series model selection (CrossValidated)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">Instead of using standard k-folds cross-validation, you have to pay attention to the fact that a time series is not randomly distributed data — it is inherently ordered by chronological order. If a pattern emerges in later time periods for example, your model may still pick up on it even if that effect doesn’t hold in earlier years!</p>
<p class="c0">You’ll want to do something like forward chaining where you’ll be able to model on past data then look at forward-facing data.</p>

<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q16- How is a decision tree pruned?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_%28decision_trees%29" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_%28decision_trees%29', 'Pruning (decision trees)');" class="c1" target="_blank">Pruning (decision trees)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">Pruning is what happens in decision trees when branches that have weak predictive power are removed in order to reduce the complexity of the model and increase the predictive accuracy of a decision tree model. Pruning can happen bottom-up and top-down, with approaches such as reduced error pruning and cost complexity pruning.</p>
<p class="c0">Reduced error pruning is perhaps the simplest version: replace each node. If it doesn’t decrease predictive accuracy, keep it pruned. While simple, this heuristic actually comes pretty close to an approach that would optimize for maximum accuracy.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q17- Which is more important to you– model accuracy, or model performance?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox', 'Accuracy paradox (Wikipedia)');" class="c1" target="_blank">Accuracy paradox (Wikipedia)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">This question tests your grasp of the nuances of machine learning model performance! Machine learning interview questions often look towards the details. There are models with higher accuracy that can perform worse in predictive power — how does that make sense?</p>
<p class="c0">Well, it has everything to do with how model accuracy is only a subset of model performance, and at that, a sometimes misleading one. For example, if you wanted to detect fraud in a massive dataset with a sample of millions, a more accurate model would most likely predict no fraud at all if only a vast minority of cases were fraud. However, this would be useless for a predictive model — a model designed to find fraud that asserted there was no fraud at all! Questions like this help you demonstrate that you understand model accuracy<span class="c2">&nbsp;isn’t the be-all and end-all of model performance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q18- What’s the F1 score? How would you use it?</span></strong></p>

<p class="c0">The F1 score is a measure of a model’s performance. It is a weighted average of the precision and recall of a model, with results tending to 1 being the best, and those tending to 0 being the worst. You would use it in classification tests where true negatives don’t matter much.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q19- How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em>More reading: <span class="c5"><a href="http://machinelearningmastery.com/tactics-to-combat-imbalanced-classes-in-your-machine-learning-dataset/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://machinelearningmastery.com/tactics-to-combat-imbalanced-classes-in-your-machine-learning-dataset/', '8 Tactics to Combat Imbalanced Classes in Your Machine Learning Dataset (Machine Learning Mastery)');" class="c1" target="_blank">8 Tactics to Combat Imbalanced Classes in Your Machine Learning Dataset (Machine Learning Mastery)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">An imbalanced dataset is when you have, for example, a classification test and 90% of the data is in one class. That leads to problems: an accuracy of 90% can be skewed if you have no predictive power on the other category of data! Here are a few tactics to get over the hump:</p>
<p class="c0"><strong>1-</strong> Collect more data to even the imbalances in the dataset.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong>2-</strong> Resample the dataset to correct for imbalances.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong>3-</strong> Try a different algorithm altogether on your dataset.</p>
<p class="c0">What’s important here is that you have a keen sense for what damage an unbalanced dataset can cause, and how to balance that.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q20- When should you use classification over regression?</span></strong></p>

<p class="c0">Classification produces discrete values and dataset to strict categories, while regression gives you continuous results that allow you to better distinguish differences between individual points. You would use classification over regression if you wanted your results to reflect the belongingness of data points in your dataset to certain explicit categories (ex: If you wanted to know whether a name was male or female rather than just how correlated they were with male and female names.)</p>

<p class="c0 c10"><span class="c9">Ensemble techniques use a combination of learning algorithms to optimize better predictive performance. They typically reduce overfitting in models and make the model more robust (unlikely to be influenced by small changes in the training data).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0 c10"><span class="c9">You could list some examples of ensemble methods, from bagging to boosting to a “bucket of models” method and demonstrate how they could increase predictive power.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c10">This is a simple restatement of a fundamental problem in machine learning: the possibility of overfitting training data and carrying the noise of that data through to the test set, thereby providing inaccurate generalizations.</p>
<p class="c0 c10">There are three main methods to avoid overfitting:</p>
<p class="c0 c10"><strong>1-</strong> Keep the model simpler: reduce variance by taking into account fewer variables and parameters, thereby removing some of the noise in the training data.</p>
<p class="c0 c10"><strong>2-</strong> Use cross-validation techniques such as k-folds cross-validation.</p>
<p class="c0 c10"><strong>3-</strong> Use regularization techniques such as LASSO that penalize certain model parameters if they’re likely to cause overfitting.</p>

<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q25- What’s the “kernel trick” and how is it useful?</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c5">More reading:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method', 'Kernel method (Wikipedia)');" class="c1" target="_blank">Kernel method (Wikipedia)</a></span></em></p>
<p class="c0">The Kernel trick involves kernel functions that can enable in higher-dimension spaces without explicitly calculating the coordinates of points within that dimension: instead, kernel functions compute the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in a feature space. This allows them the very useful attribute of calculating the coordinates of higher dimensions while being computationally cheaper than the explicit calculation of said coordinates.&nbsp;Many algorithms can be expressed in terms of inner products. Using the kernel trick enables us effectively run &nbsp;algorithms in a high-dimensional space with lower-dimensional data.</p>

<p class="c0">These machine learning interview questions test your knowledge of programming principles you need to implement machine learning principles in practice. Machine learning interview questions tend to be technical questions that test your logic and programming skills: this section focuses more on the latter.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q26- How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset?</span></strong></p>

<p class="c0">You could find missing/corrupted data in a dataset and either drop those rows or columns, or decide to replace them with another value.</p>
<p class="c0">In Pandas, there are two very useful methods: isnull() and dropna() that will help you find columns of data with missing or corrupted data and drop those values. If you want to fill the invalid values with a placeholder value (for example, 0), you could use the fillna() method.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q27- Do you have experience with Spark or big data tools for machine learning?</span></strong></p>

<p class="c0">You’ll want to get familiar with the meaning of big data for different companies and the different tools they’ll want. Spark is the big data tool most in demand now, able to handle immense datasets with speed. Be honest if you don’t have experience with the tools demanded, but also take a look at job descriptions and see what tools pop up: you’ll want to invest in familiarizing yourself with them.</p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c2">Q28- Pick an algorithm. Write the psuedo-code for a parallel implementation.</span></strong></p>

<p class="c0">An array is an ordered collection of objects. A linked list is a series of objects with pointers that direct how to process them sequentially. An array assumes that every element has the same size, unlike the linked list. A linked list can more easily grow organically: an array has to be pre-defined or re-defined for organic growth. Shuffling a linked list involves changing which points direct where — meanwhile, shuffling an array is more complex and takes more memory.</p>
